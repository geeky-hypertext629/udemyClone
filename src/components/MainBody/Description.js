            <p><b>Hear what my students have to say</b></p>
            <p>Absolutely fantastic tutorial series. I cannot thank you enough. The quality is first class and your presentational skills are second to none. Keep up this excellent work. You really rock!﻿ - Paul Whitehouse

                <br /> The instructor, Max, is very enthusiastic and engaging. He does a great job of explaining what he's doing and why rather than having students just mimic his coding. Max was also very responsive to questions. I would recommend this course and any others that he offers. Thanks, Max!

                As a person new to both JavaScript and Angular 2 I found this course extremely helpful because Max does a great job of explaining all the important concepts behind the code. Max has a great teaching ability to focus on what his audience needs to understand.</p>
            <p><b>This Course uses TypeScript</b></p>
            <p>TypeScript is the main language used by the official Angular team and the language you'll mostly see in Angular tutorials. It's a superset to JavaScript and makes writing Angular apps really easy. Using it ensures, that you will have the best possible preparation for creating Angular apps. Check out the free videos for more information.
                <br />
                TypeScript knowledge is, however, not required - basic JavaScript knowledge is enough.</p>
            <p><b>Why Angular?</b></p>
            <p>Angular is the next big deal. Being the successor of the overwhelmingly successful Angular.js framework it’s bound to shape the future of frontend development in a similar way. The powerful features and capabilities of Angular allow you to create complex, customizable, modern, responsive and user friendly web applications.
                <br />
                Angular is faster than Angular 1 and offers a much more flexible and modular development approach. After taking this course you’ll be able to fully take advantage of all those features and start developing awesome applications immediately.
                <br />
                Due to the drastic differences between Angular 1 and Angular (= Angular 2+) you don’t need to know anything about Angular.js to be able to benefit from this course and build your futures projects with Angular.</p>

            <p><b>Get a very deep understanding of how to create Angular applications</b></p>
            <p>This course will teach you all the fundamentals about modules, directives, components, databinding, routing, HTTP access and much more! We will take a lot of deep dives and each section is backed up with a real project. All examples showcase the features Angular offers and how to apply them correctly.</p>
            <p>Specifically you will learn:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Which architecture Angular uses.</li>
                <li>How to use TypeScript to write Angular applications</li>
                <li>All about directives and components, including the creation of custom directives/ components</li>
